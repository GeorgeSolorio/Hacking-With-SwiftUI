## Usage

If you'd like to test any of these apps out, choose any folder you're curious about.
Once selected, launch the project in Xcode and run it on an iOS simulator. 
Some apps might not be able to run on a simulator due to a lack of required hardware, if so 
try it out on a physical iOS device.
