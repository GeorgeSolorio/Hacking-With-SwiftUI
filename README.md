## About
A set of one day projects based on Paul Hudson's [Hacking with iOS SwiftUI tutorials](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui)

## Learning Objectives
* Gain an understanding of Imperative vs Declerative programming
* Explore SwiftUI's new form of programming
* Gain an understanding of how wrappers such as @Observable, @Publisher, @State ... etc work
* How data can be transfered from one view to another
* How to share an object to other views
* How to integrate UIKit objects into SwiftUI
* And so much more

## Usage

If you'd like to test any of these apps out, choose any folder you're curious about.
Once selected, launch the project in Xcode and run it on an iOS simulator. 
Some apps might not be able to run on a simulator due to a lack of required hardware, if so 
try it out on a physical iOS device.

Here's a list of apps you can checkout!
